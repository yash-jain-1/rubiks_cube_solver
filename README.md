# Rubik's Cube Solver

This project models and solves a Rubik's Cube using Kociembaâ€™s Two-Phase Algorithm.

## Features
- Cube simulation with real move logic (U, D, etc.)
- Scrambler
- Solver using `kociemba` Python library
- Visual output in text

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Coming Soon
- Full move set
- 2D/3D visualizer
- Beginner method solver
